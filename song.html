    <h2 class="text-1"><a href="song1.html" class="no-underline">1. Ranjishi Sahi</a></h2>
    <p class="text-1">"Ranjish Hi Sahi" is a deeply emotional Urdu ghazal written by Ahmed Faraz and made famous by Mehdi Hassan. The song captures the anguish of unrequited love and longing, where the singer pleads for their beloved to return—even if only to hurt them again. It reflects themes of pain, estrangement, and the paradox of love, where even suffering in love is preferable to complete abandonment.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2"><a href="song2.html" class="no-underline">2. Aaj Jaane Ki Zidd Na Karo</a></h2>
    <p class="text-2">"Aaj Jaane Ki Zid Na Karo" is a timeless geet written by Pakistani poet Fayyaz Hashmi and composed by Sohail Rana. 
        Originally popularized by classical vocalist Habib Wali Mohammad in the 1973 Pakistani film 'Badal Aur Bijli', 
        the song later gained legendary status through ghazal singer Farida Khanum’s rendition in 1993. 
        Sung in 'Raag Yaman Kalyan', this deeply romantic and melancholic piece expresses a lover's desperate plea for their beloved to stay a little longer, 
        cherishing fleeting moments of togetherness. The song’s evocative lyrics and soul-stirring melody have made it an enduring classic, 
        with many celebrated artists reinterpreting it over the years.</p>

    <h2 class="text-3"><a href="song3.html" class="no-underline">3. Baat Karni Thi</a></h2>
    <p class="text-3">        This ghazal by Bahadur Shah Zafar is a poignant expression of longing, loss, and the passage of time. The poet reflects on how life, love, and companionship have changed, lamenting that conversations and gatherings, once effortless and joyous, have now become difficult and burdened with sorrow. The verses explore themes of restlessness, heartbreak, and the transformative power of love and separation. Through evocative imagery—of eyes casting spells, reflections illuminating, and chains echoing in solitude—Zafar captures a deep sense of nostalgia and despair. The ghazal resonates not just as a personal lament but as a reflection of the decline of the Mughal era, mirroring the poet's own struggles and the fading grandeur of his time.

    <h2 class="text-2"><a href="song4.html" class="no-underline">4. Mohobbat Karne Wale</a></h2>
    <p class="text-2">            This ghazal by Hafeez Jalandhari explores themes of unfulfilled love, longing, and separation. The poet reflects on the idea that while there may be many admirers of the beloved, he himself will not be among them. He contrasts the weight of personal sorrow against the world's collective grief, suggesting that the pain of loving and losing the beloved surpasses all other troubles. Despite the possibility of reunion, the scars of separation remain, making love a bittersweet experience. The poem beautifully captures the essence of heartbreak, quiet acceptance, and the melancholic fate of the unrequited lover.    </p>
